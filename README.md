## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic Dataset
### Introduction
This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, which is available on Kaggle. The primary goal is to explore the relationships between various variables in the dataset and to identify patterns and trends that can provide valuable insights into the survival rates and other key aspects of the Titanic passengers.

### Contents of the Repository
Jupyter Notebook: The main analysis and visualizations are contained in a Jupyter notebook (SCT_DS_2.ipynb).
Dataset: The Titanic dataset used for this analysis is provided in the repository (train.csv).
### Data Cleaning
Before conducting the EDA, the dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the results. Key steps included:

Handling Missing Values: Strategies were applied to deal with missing data, such as imputing or dropping values depending on the context.
Data Type Conversion: Ensuring that each variable is of the correct data type for analysis.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features that might help in understanding the relationships between variables better.
### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA process involved examining the dataset from various angles to uncover interesting patterns and insights. Key areas of exploration included:

Univariate Analysis: Examining the distribution of individual variables, such as age, fare, and gender.
Bivariate and Multivariate Analysis: Investigating the relationships between multiple variables, such as the impact of age, gender, and class on survival rates.
Visualization: Using various plots, including histograms, bar charts, and box plots, to visually explore the data.
### Insights and Conclusions
Through the EDA, several patterns and trends were identified that offer insights into the factors that influenced passenger survival on the Titanic. These insights can be valuable for further predictive modeling and analysis.

### How to Run the Notebook
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed (e.g., pandas, matplotlib, seaborn).
Open the Jupyter notebook (SCT_DS_2.ipynb) and run the cells to replicate the analysis.
### Conclusion
This project demonstrates the importance of thorough data cleaning and exploratory analysis before delving into more complex modeling tasks. By carefully examining the dataset, we can uncover valuable insights and set a solid foundation for any further analysis.
